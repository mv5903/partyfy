## Party Screen with song requests!

This is a simple party screen that allows you to request songs to be played at the party. It is a simple web app that uses the Spotify API to search for songs and add them to a playlist. It allows users to easily request songs to be played at the party, which are added to the owner's Spotify queue. 

### NOTE 4/28/23:
This project is currently undergoing a revamp to isolate itself from Home Assistant and be a standalone web app. This readme will be updated once the project is ready for use.

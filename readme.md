## Party Screen with song requests!

This is a simple party screen that allows you to request songs to be played at the party. It is a simple web app that uses the Spotify API to search for songs and add them to a playlist. It allows users to easily request songs to be played at the party, which are added to the owner's Spotify queue. 

This project also aims to be a great replacement to Spotify's Group Session functionality, which in my opinion, is very annoying. It requires the user to keep sending invites, frequent disconnections, music skipping back and forth in time, and much more.

Because this application only relies on one person playing music on Spotify, outside users can easily view and add to their queue very easily.


# Initial Release 5/29/23: v2.0
### You can now set up "unattended queues" and send requests to your friends
Have both of your friends sign into the app, set up a username, authenticate with Spotify, then add your friends through the friends icon on the top right. Be sure to enable "unattended queues", which will allow your friends to search Spotify for a song and add it to your queue.

#### Known issues: 
1. The friend and account icons require the user to click on their respective icons in order to close them.
2. On desktop only, the host screen is currently broken (note that you can still access the unattended queues option by clicking on your profile button, then clicking on options.)

## Party Screen with song requests!

This is a simple party screen that allows you to request songs to be played at the party. It is a simple web app that uses the Spotify API to search for songs and add them to a playlist. It allows users to easily request songs to be played at the party, which are added to the owner's Spotify queue. 

This project also aims to be a great replacement to Spotify's Group Session functionality, which imo, is very annoying, requires the user to keep sending invites, frequent disconnections, music skipping back and forth in time, and much more.

Because this application only relies on one person playing music on Spotify, outside users can easily view and add to their queue very easily.

### NOTE 4/28/23:
This project is currently undergoing a revamp to isolate itself from Home Assistant and be a standalone web app. This readme will be updated once the project is ready for use.
